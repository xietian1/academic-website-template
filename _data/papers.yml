    abstract = {More than 150 cellular networks worldwide have rolled out massive IoT services such as smart metering and environmental monitoring. Such cellular IoT services share the existing cellular network architecture with non-IoT (e.g., smartphone) ones. When they are newly integrated into the cellular network, new security vulnerabilities may happen from imprudent integration. In this work, we explore the security vulnerabilities of the cellular IoT from both system-integrated and service-integrated aspects. We discover five vulnerabilities spanning cellular standard design defects, network operation slips, and IoT device implementation flaws. Threateningly, they allow an adversary to remotely identify IP addresses and phone numbers assigned to cellular IoT devices and launch data/text spamming attacks against them. We experimentally validate these vulnerabilities and attacks with three major U.S. IoT carriers. The attack evaluation result shows that the adversary can raise an IoT data bill by up to $226 with less than 120 MB spam traffic and increase an IoT text bill at a rate of $5 per second; moreover, cellular IoT devices may suffer from denial of IoT services. We finally propose, prototype, and evaluate recommended solutions.},

    abstract = {Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency which supports payment services via the
    Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. However, Bitcoin suffers from a fundamental problem.
    In practice, a secure Bitcoin transaction requires the payee to wait for at least
    6 block confirmations (one hour) to be validated. Such a long waiting time thwarts
    the wide deployment of the Bitcoin payment services because many usage scenarios require
    a much shorter waiting time. In this paper, we propose BFastPay to accelerate the
    Bitcoin payment validation. BFastPay employs a smart contract called BFPayArbitrator
    to host the payer's security deposit and fulfills the role of a trusted payment arbitrator
    which guarantees that a payee always receives the payment even if attacks occur. BFastpay
    is a routing-free solution that eliminates the requirement for payment routing in
    the traditional payment routing network (e.g., Lightning Network). The theoretical
    and experimental results show that BFast is able to significantly reduce the Bitcoin
    payment waiting time (e.g., from 60 mins to less than 1 second) with nearly no extra
    operation cost.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency. With the proliferation of smartphones
    and the high-speed mobile Internet, more and more users have started accessing their
    Bitcoin wallets on their smartphones. Users can download and install a variety of
    Bitcoin wallet applications (e.g., Coinbase, Luno, Bitcoin Wallet) on their smartphones
    and access their Bitcoin wallets anytime and anywhere. However, it is still unknown
    whether these Bitcoin wallet smartphone applications are secure or if they are new
    attack surfaces for adversaries to attack these application users. In this work, we
    explored the insecurity of the 10 most popular Bitcoin wallet smartphone applications
    and discovered three security vulnerabilities. By exploiting them, adversaries can
    launch various attacks including Bitcoin deanonymization, reflection and amplification
    spamming, and wallet fraud attacks. To address the identified security vulnerabilities,
    we developed a phone-side Bitcoin Security Rectifier to secure Bitcoin wallet smartphone
    application users. The developed rectifier does not require any modifications to current
    wallet applications and is compliant with Bitcoin standards.},
